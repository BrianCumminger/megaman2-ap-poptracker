## Installation

Just download the lastest build or source and put in your PopTracker packs folder.

## Features
Stage select overview plus maps for each individual stage. Enabled location settings (e-tanks, energy pickups) are auto-detected and enabled/disabled (can be configured manually)

What's not handled:
- Enemy weaknesses are not tracked. All bosses are shown as in logic if you can reach them.

## Usage
When using Archipelago auto tracking, logic settings mentioned in "Features" will all be set automatically.  For manual operation (or to check which settings are active), click on the "Open Pack Settings" button at the top of PopTracker while this pack is loaded.
