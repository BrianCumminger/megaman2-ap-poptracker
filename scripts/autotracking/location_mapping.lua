-- use this file to map the AP location ids to your locations
-- to reference a location in Pop use @ in the beginning and then path to the section (more info: https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker/blob/master/doc/PACKS.md#locations)
-- to reference an item use it's code
-- here are the SM locations as an example: https://github.com/Cyb3RGER/sm_ap_tracker/blob/main/scripts/autotracking/location_mapping.lua
